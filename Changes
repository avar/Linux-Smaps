Revision history for Perl extension Linux::Smaps.

0.06  Wed Jun  4 11:39:18 CEST 2008
	- sometimes vmas are listed twice in /proc/self/smaps.
	  (perhaps a kernel bug) Linux::Smaps ignores the duplicates
	- using POSIX::setlocale during test to ensure english error messages

	- VMA accessor methods and Smaps summary methods are created on

	  module easily.
